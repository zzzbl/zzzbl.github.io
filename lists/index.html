            London is divided into several parts: the City, Westminster, the West End, and               the East End.
            The heart of London is the City, its financial and business centre. Numerous                 banks, offices, and firms are situated there, including the Bank of England, the             Stock Exchange, and the Old Bailey. Few people live here, but over a million                 people come to the City to work. There are some famous ancient buildings within               the City. Perhaps the most striking of them is the St. Paul's Cathedral, the                 greatest of English churches. It was built in the 17th century by Sir Christopher             Wren. The Tower of London was founded by
